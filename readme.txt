BlackBar is a plugin for WordPress developers. It collects and displays errors, executed queries, globals, templates, and provides a profiler.

== Description ==

BlackBar is an unobtrusive debug bar attached to the bottom of the browser window.

How can it help you with development:
1. Inspect global variables (GET, POST, COOKIE, SERVER)
2. Debug both front-end and admin area
3. Displays executed MySQL queries and the time it took to execute each query
4. Profiler for measuring performance of your plugins and themes
5. Shows any PHP errors that occurred when loading a page

BlackBar is a rewrite of [blackbox-debug-bar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/blackbox-debug-bar/) by [Grzegorz Winiarski](https://profiles.wordpress.org/gwin) which appears to be abandoned as it has not been updated since 2013.
